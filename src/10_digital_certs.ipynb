    "\n",
    "Objective: Digital certificates are used to define a trust infrastructure within PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). A certificate can hold a key pair, while a distributable certificate will only contain the public key. In this lab we will read-in digital certificates and analyse them. A lab demo is [here](https://youtu.be/-uNQFv0GTZc).\n",
