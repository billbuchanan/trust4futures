## 3-4pm (CET) World-leaders in Cryptography: Anna Lysyanskaya
Anna is a Professor of Computer Science at Brown University. Her research spans many areas of advanced cryptography including with digital signatures, group signatures, blind signatures, e-cash and anonymous digital credentials. She was originally from Ukraine, and undertook her masters degree at MIT in 1999, and then went onto a PhD in 2002 in the areas of Signature Schemes and Applications to Cryptographic Protocol Design. She joined Brown University in 2002, and was made a full professor in 2013. She is a member of the board of directors at the IACR, along with serving  on Scientific Advisory Board for the Board of Directors of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). In 2024, she was awarded the Levchin Prize for a contribution entitled "For the Development of Anonymous Credentials".

# Key Principles of AI and Cyber

## GenAI
* The Turing Test was devised by Alan Turing. It tests a machine for ability to exhibit human intelligence.
* There are many types of human intelligence, including spatial intelligence (picture smart), inter-personnel intelligence (people smart) and intra-personal intelligence (self smart)
* ChatGPT used for text analysis, DALLE-3 for image generation, Sora for video generation and Whisper for audio.
* Back propagation used to train a Neural Network.
* Convolution is used to convert a Neural Network input to a set of parameters.
* Forward propagation used for to fire neurons in the Neural Network.
* Hallucinations are where GenAI gets the result wrong.
* Jailbreaking an LLM involves taking it outside its limits for ethical and moral guidelines.
* The singararity is the point at which machine intelligence exceeds human intelligence.
* The first step of training an LLM is to label the required outputs behavour for training data.
* The second step of training an LLM involves a human grading a range of outputs, from best to worst.
* The third step of training an LLM involves receiving a reward for the correct outputs.
* Key threats for attacking GenAI  are jailbreaks, reverse psychology, model escape and prompt injection.
* Certain key words can sometimes be used to detect the presence of LLM outputs, such as for the word of "delve".
* Ways of detecting machine activity include forced persona, too informal and lack of a personality.
* way of detecting human activity include humanlike tone, informal tone, and SPAG (Spelling and Grammar) errors.
* Llama 3 is an open source LLM model from Meta. It is available in 3.2 billion and 70 billion parameters.
* Google created the Transformer method in 2017, and which supported the use to token predication and LSTM (Long-short-term-memory).
* ollamma is a tool to prompt the Llama 3 model.
  
## PQC
* Quantum computers uses Qubits to process data.
* Shorr's algorithm can crack existing public key methods.
* Gover's algorithm can crack 128-bit symmetric key and hashing methods.
* Kyber selected for a Post Quantum Key Exchange and Public Key Encryption method, along with HQC.
* Dilithium, FALCON and SPHINCS+ selected for a Post Quantum Digital Signature method.
* The most common key exchange method is ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman).
* The most common digital signature methods are RSA PSS, ECDSA and EdDSA.
* The most common public key encryption method is RSA OAEP.
* Kyber (ML-KEM) is a lattice method and is standardized with the NIST defined FIPS 203 standard.
* Dilithium (ML-DSA) is a lattice method and is standardized with the NIST defined FIPS 204 standard.
* SPHINCS+ (SLH-DSA) is a hash based method and is standardized with the NIST defined FIPS 205 standard. It has small key sizes but a relatively large signature size.
* FALCON is a lattice based method and is standardized with the NIST defined FIPS 206 standard. It has smaller key and cipher sizes than Dilithium.
* HQC has been added as a key exchange alterative to Kyber (ML-KEM).
